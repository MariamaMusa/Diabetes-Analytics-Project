# Diabetes Analytics Project
> This project analyzed healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information data to identify the socioeconomic, clinical, and behavioral factors most associated with diabetes risk, and built a predictive model to estimate diabetes status from them - equipping governments and NGOs to target screening and interventions where they're needed most, in a country where over 80% of diabetes cases occur and diagnosis often comes too late.

## 1. Project Overview
**Context:** Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health burden - 589 million adults live with it worldwide (1 in 9), with cases projected to reach 853 million by 2050. Over 81% of those affected live in low- and middle-income countries, where prevalence is rising fastest and nearly half of diagnosed adults aren't on medication. Compounding this, an estimated 43% of cases go undiagnosed. In a country like Ghana, this makes data-driven identification of at-risk populations essential for guiding limited healthcare resources toward the people and interventions that need them most.

**Problem Statement:** Governments and NGOs currently lack a clear, data-backed view of which socioeconomic factors, pre-existing health conditions, and lifestyle behaviours are most associated with diabetes risk in the population they serve - making it difficult to target screening, resource allocation, and health interventions effectively. This project analyzes healthcare and lifestyle survey data to identify these risk patterns, and builds a predictive model that can estimate an individual's diabetes status from selected health and lifestyle characteristics - supporting both population-level planning and individual risk awareness.

**Approach:** After defining stakeholder objectives, I sourced the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (BRFSS 2015 survey), deliberately introduced realistic data quality issues to simulate a real-world messy dataset using Claude, then cleaned and prepared it in Python before analyzing and visualizing it in Power BI and building a predictive model in Python.

**Outcome:** A cleaned, analysis-ready dataset, a Power BI dashboard showing which socioeconomic, clinical, and lifestyle factors are most associated with diabetes prevalence across different population segments and a predictive model capable of estimating diabetes status from selected health and lifestyle inputs.

---

## 2. Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** Identify the socioeconomic, clinical, and lifestyle factors most associated with diabetes prevalence, and build a predictive model that estimates diabetes status from selected features.
- **Secondary Objective 1:** Determine whether socioeconomic background (income, education) influences diabetes prevalence, to support equitable healthcare access planning by government.
- **Secondary Objective 2:** Assess whether pre-existing health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, high cholesterol) increase diabetes risk, so health authorities can prepare targeted care ahead of time.
- **Secondary Objective 3:** Identify which population segments and lifestyle habits should be prioritized in NGO/health interventions, and what those interventions should address.
- **Secondary Objective 4:** Give patients/individuals a way to estimate their own diabetes risk from personal health and lifestyle characteristics, supporting early awareness and self-directed screening.

> 💡 *Every analysis decision in this project traces back to one of these objectives.*

## 3. Project Scope & Tools

### Scope

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **In Scope** | CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (BRFSS 2015 survey), individual-level self-reported health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic indicators, and diabetes status for U.S. respondents. The dataset was deliberately modified with realistic data quality issues to practice a full data analytics workflow, analyzed and framed around questions relevant to a low- and middle-income country context (e.g., Ghana).|
| **Out of Scope** | Geographic/regional analysis (no location variable in the dataset), trend or time-series analysis, gestational diabetes/pregnancy-related hyperglycemia (no pregnancy variable present). Underlying values (income brackets, prevalence rates, healthcare access patterns) reflect the U.S. context in which the data was originally collected, and are not directly generalizable to Ghana or another lower and middle income countries.|
| **Time Period** | Data reflects a single point-in-time survey (BRFSS 2015) - no time-series component.|
| **Granularity** | Row-level / individual respondent - one row per survey participant. |

### Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tool(s) Used |
|----------|-------------|
| Data Storage | CSV files |
| Data Cleaning | Python (pandas) |
| Analysis | Power BI |
| Visualization | Power BI|
| Machine Learning | Python (Scikit-learn) |
| Version Control | Github |
| Documentation | Markdown |

## 5. Data Workflow

<!--
  Show how data moved through your project - from source to output.
  Every transformation decision should be traceable here.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  1. Source: "Monthly CSV exports pulled from the internal POS system.
              Five files, one per region, covering Jan 2023–Jun 2024."
  2. Ingestion: "Loaded into Python using pandas. Files concatenated into
                 a single dataframe (approx. 340,000 rows)."
  3. Cleaning: "Removed 1.2% of rows with null transaction IDs.
                Standardised date formats across regional files.
                Resolved product category naming inconsistencies (3 variants → 1)."
  4. Transformation: "Created a returns_rate field at product-category level.
                      Aggregated to weekly and regional grain for trend analysis."
  5. Analysis: "Descriptive statistics, regional comparison, return rate
                segmentation by product category."
  6. Output: "Summary report (PDF), annotated notebook, processed CSV."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Data was cleaned and analysed." (No chain. No decisions. No trust.)
-->

```
[Data Source(s)]
      ↓
[Ingestion / Collection Method]
      ↓
[Cleaning & Transformation]
      ↓
[Analysis / Modelling / Querying]
      ↓
[Output / Visualisation / Reporting]
```

1. **Source:** [Where did the data come from? Format, size, access method.]
2. **Ingestion:** [How was it brought in?]
3. **Cleaning:** [What issues did you find and fix?]
4. **Transformation:** [What new fields, aggregations, or structures did you create?]
5. **Analysis:** [What methods - statistical, visual, query-based, model-based?]
6. **Output:** [What form do the results take?]

---

## 6. Data Model & Schema

<!--
  Define your fields so that someone reading your analysis can follow along
  without digging through your code.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE (one row example):
  | transaction_id | string | Unique identifier per sales transaction | TXN-00482 |
  | return_flag    | boolean | Whether the transaction included a return | TRUE |
  | region_code    | string | Two-letter identifier for store region | "NE" |

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ Skipping this section because "the field names are self-explanatory."
     They're not. Not to a reviewer. Not to you in six months.

  📌 FOR SQL PROJECTS: If you have multiple tables, create one block per table.
     Describe join keys and relationships here. Your ERD (Section 7) will
     visualise what this section describes in text.

  📌 FOR NON-SQL PROJECTS: Describe the shape of your dataset informally
     if a formal schema doesn't apply. Even one paragraph is more helpful than nothing.
-->

### Dataset / Table: `[name]`

| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Example Value |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `[field_1]` | [string / int / date / float / boolean] | [What this field represents] | [Non-sensitive example] |
| `[field_2]` | [string / int / date / float / boolean] | [What this field represents] | [Non-sensitive example] |
| `[field_3]` | [string / int / date / float / boolean] | [What this field represents] | [Non-sensitive example] |

> **Row count (approx.):** [X rows]
> **Date range:** [Start] – [End]
> **Key join / relationship:** [e.g., `orders.customer_id` → `customers.id`]

*Add additional table blocks as needed for multi-table projects.*

---

## 8. Analysis & Metrics

<!--
  Explain what you measured and how - before you share what you found.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  Metric: "Customer Return Rate"
  Definition: "Number of transactions flagged as returns divided by total
               transactions, calculated at product-category and regional grain."
  Why It Matters: "Return rate - not sales volume - was hypothesised to
                  explain regional revenue gaps. This metric tests that hypothesis."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ Defining a metric only in code: SUM(returns) / COUNT(transaction_id)
     That's an implementation. Write the plain-language definition here.
     Both belong in your project - the definition in the README,
     the implementation in the code.
-->

### Analytical Approach

[Describe how you approached the analysis. Were you exploring patterns? Testing a hypothesis? Building and validating a pipeline? Be honest about your method - exploratory work is valid, just call it that.]

### Key Metrics Defined

| Metric | Plain-Language Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| `[Metric 1]` | [What it measures, in one sentence] | [What decision or question it answers] |
| `[Metric 2]` | [What it measures, in one sentence] | [What decision or question it answers] |
| `[Metric 3]` | [What it measures, in one sentence] | [What decision or question it answers] |

### Methods Used

- [e.g., Descriptive statistics - distribution, central tendency, outlier detection]
- [e.g., Trend analysis across [time period]]
- [e.g., Segmentation / group comparison by [dimension]]
- [e.g., Correlation analysis between [variable A] and [variable B]]
- [e.g., SQL window functions for [specific aggregation]]
- [e.g., Custom aggregation or transformation logic in [tool]]

## 9. Key Insights

<!--
  Findings + implications. Not just what happened - what it means.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  ✅ "Return rates, not sales volume, explain Region A's underperformance.
      Region A's return rate on home goods was 34% - more than double the
      company average. Revenue was not lost at the point of sale; it was
      lost post-sale through refunds. This points to a fulfilment or
      product quality issue specific to that region, not a demand problem."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Region A had lower revenue than other regions in Q4."
     (That's an observation. It describes what happened.
      An insight says what it means and where to look next.)

  Aim for 3–6 insights. Quality over quantity.
-->

**Insight 1: [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests. One short paragraph.]

**Insight 2: [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests.]

**Insight 3: [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests.]

**Insight 4 (if applicable): [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests.]

---

## 10. Recommendations

<!--
  Action-oriented. Addressed to a real audience.
  Tied explicitly to the insight that supports each one.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  Priority: High
  Recommendation: "Conduct a fulfilment audit for home goods deliveries
                   in Region A - specifically investigating whether returns
                   correlate with a particular warehouse, carrier, or SKU batch."
  Based On: Insight 1 - return rate anomaly in Region A
  Owner: Operations / Supply Chain team

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Improve the return rate."
     (Not actionable. Doesn't say who, how, or where to start.)
  ❌ "Further analysis is needed."
     (This is a placeholder, not a recommendation.)
-->

| Priority | Recommendation | Based On | Suggested Owner |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| High | [Specific, actionable step] | [Insight it comes from] | [Who should act] |
| Medium | [Specific, actionable step] | [Insight it comes from] | [Who should act] |
| Low | [Exploratory or longer-term suggestion] | [Insight it comes from] | [Who should act] |

---

## 11. Assumptions & Limitations

<!--
  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  Assumption: "Transaction records were assumed to be complete for all five regions.
               No validation was performed against source system record counts."
  Limitation: "The analysis cannot distinguish between returns initiated by
               the customer vs. returns initiated by the business (e.g., recalls).
               If business-initiated returns are concentrated in Region A, the
               return rate finding may reflect a policy decision, not a quality issue."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ Leaving this section blank or writing "None known."
     Every project has limitations. Documenting them is a sign of
     analytical maturity - not a confession of failure.
-->

### Assumptions
- [What did you treat as true without being able to verify?]
- [What simplifications did you make for scope or feasibility?]
- [What domain rules or definitions did you accept as given?]

### Limitations
- [What gaps exist in the data?]
- [What analysis was out of scope but could affect interpretation?]
- [What would a more rigorous version of this project include?]
- [Are there known biases in the data source or collection method?]

> *The goal here is pre-emptive Q&A. What would a thoughtful skeptic push back on? Document the answer here, before they ask.*

## 12. Future Enhancements

<!--
  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  ✅ "Automate the monthly data pull from the POS export folder using
      a scheduled Python script, replacing the current manual process."
  ✅ "Expand the return rate analysis to include carrier-level data,
      which was unavailable in this dataset but exists in the logistics system."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Add a machine learning model."
     (Vague, and disconnected from the actual findings of this project.)
  ❌ Listing aspirational features that don't follow logically from the work.
